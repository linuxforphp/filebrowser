## FileBrowser - Powerful Multi-User File Manager

FileBrowser is a free, open-source, self-hosted web application for managing files and folders.

You can manage files inside your local repository folder (on your server's hard drive) or connect to other storage adapters (see below).

FileBrowser has multi-user support so you can have admins and other users managing files with different access permissions, roles and home folders.

All basic file operations are supported: copy, move, rename, edit, create, delete, preview, zip, unzip, download, upload.

If allowed, users can download multiple files or folders at once.

File upload supports drag&drop, progress bar, pause and resume. Upload is chunked so you should be able to upload large files regardless of your server configuration.

## Typical use cases
- share a folder with colleagues, your team, friends or family
- give students access to upload their work
- allow workers to upload field data / docs / images
- use as cloud backup
- manage cdn with multiple people
- use as ftp/sftp replacement
- manage s3 or other 3rd party cloud storage
- use to quickly zip and download remote files

## Features & Goals
- Multiple storage adapters (Local, FTP, Amazon S3, Dropbox, DO Spaces, Azure Blob and many others via [Flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem))
- Multiple auth adapters with roles and permissions (Store users in json file, database or use WordPress)
- Multiple session adapters (Native File, Pdo, Redis, MongoDB, Memcached and others via [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Session/Storage/Handler))
- Single page front-end (built with [Vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) and [Buefy](https://github.com/buefy/buefy))
- Chunked uploads (built with [Resumable.js](https://github.com/23/resumable.js))
- Zip and bulk download support
- Highly extensible, decoupled and tested code
- No database required

## Minimum Requirements
- PHP 7.2.5+ (with php-zip extension)

## Project setup for development (Linux)

You must have `git`, `php`, `npm`, and `composer` installed.

If you have Docker on your computer, you can run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/linuxforphp/filebrowser.git
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
vendor/bin/linuxforcomposer docker:run start
```

When you are ready to stop the container, enter the following command:

```
vendor/bin/linuxforcomposer docker:run stop-force
```

Otherwise, you can install the application manually, using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/linuxforphp/filebrowser.git
cd filebrowser
cp configuration_sample.php configuration.php
chmod -R 775 private/
chmod -R 775 repository/
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run tests & static analysis

Testing requires xdebug, php-zip and sqlite php extensions.

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse ./backend
npm run lint
npm run e2e
```

## Deployment

Set the website document root to `/dist` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder.

NOTE: For security reasons `/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people canâ€™t access any of your important files through the browser.
